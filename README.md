JavaScript: Password Generator

## Why I did this homework

The goal of this homework is to create a web application that will generate a secured password with four choices of criteria. These are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The user will choose which ones they would like afterwards, generating it randomly. The application must also be a responsive web application and have a clean user interface.

## What I learned
This homework was a very challenging one. It took everything that has been taught to the class so far, plus more. JavaScript is especially difficult for me. It reviewed a lot of the material we have covered in class, some of these are arrays and functions. Also if statements, which are heavily used in my codes to determine which of the options have been confirmed to be true using prompts and confirm interactions. Pseudo coding was very useful in determining where I needed to start and what steps to take in order to complete my goal.

## Apliciation Features

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked. A prompt will appear asking the user how long they would like their password to be, and that it must be between 8 and 128 characters. After it will ask the user to confirm if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When all is decided the users random password will appear in place of "Yours Secure Password" placeholder.
