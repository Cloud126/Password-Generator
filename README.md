# Password-Generator
JavaScript: Password Generator

## Why I did this homework

The goal of this homework is to create a web application that will generate a random password with four choices of criteria. These are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The application must also be a responsive web application and have a clean user interface.
